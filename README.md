# recommendMovieWebSite
In this project, I made a website which can recommend a random movie. You can see movie name, movie description, movie time, movie release time and IMDb point. Also you can watch the trailer of the movie. I used HTML, CSS, JS and Python. I got the data from IMBb website. I made a json by using Pyhton Selenium Modul.

And here there is a test link:
